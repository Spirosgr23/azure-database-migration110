## Project Overview
This project involves architecting and implementing a cloud-based database system on Microsoft Azure. The aim is to demonstrate hands-on expertise in cloud engineering, focusing on establishing a production environment database and migrating it to Azure SQL Database.

### Current Progress
- **Virtual Machine Setup**: Established a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure to serve as the cornerstone of the production environment. This VM emulates the functions of a Windows server, replicating the operations of an on-premise system within a company.

- **Network Configuration and Firewall Rules**: Configured the appropriate network settings and firewall rules to establish a connection to the VM using the RDP protocol.

- **Remote Connection**: Initiated a remote connection to the VM using Microsoft Remote Desktop and the RDP protocol, providing direct access to the VM's operating system for efficient management and configuration.

- **SQL Server Installation**: Installed SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on the VM. These tools are crucial for proficient database management and mirror the capabilities of a corporate database server.

- **Production Database Creation**: Created the production database by restoring from a backup file of the AdventureWorks database. This sample database emulates a fictional manufacturing company's operations, including various tables, views, stored procedures, and a diverse dataset.

### Key Technologies Used
- Microsoft Azure
- Windows Virtual Machine
- SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop
- RDP Protocol

## Next Steps
The next phase of the project will involve migrating the database to Azure SQL Database, focusing on cloud-specific aspects of database management.
